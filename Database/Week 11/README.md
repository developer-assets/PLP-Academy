## Difficulties Encountered
# Data Formatting Issues
One of the primary challenges was ensuring the CSV file was correctly formatted for MySQL import. Issues such as inconsistent delimiters, missing headers, or special characters in the data had to be resolved before a successful import could be achieved. Cleaning the data in a text editor or using a script to standardize the format was necessary.

# Handling Null Values
During the import process, several fields contained null values. Handling these appropriately, either by setting default values or using NULL where appropriate, was crucial to maintain the integrity of the dataset in the database.


## Interesting Observation
# Platform Usage Patterns

An interesting observation from the dataset is the varying engagement levels across different social media platforms. For example, certain platforms showed significantly higher average time spent per user, which could indicate higher user engagement or platform stickiness. This insight is valuable for understanding user preferences and the relative popularity of different social media platforms.

By addressing the import challenges and analyzing the unique aspects of the dataset, this repository provides a foundation for exploring social media usage patterns and user behavior.
